# Cryptography

C# Console app to exercise cryptographic algorithms. 

This project was created as a learning exercise to better understand cryptographic algorithms. It started with historic algorithms and the plan is to continue it to implement more modern algorithms. 

## Running the application

To run add files dir in Cryptography/cryptography. 
Inside this dir add the following text files:
- decoded.txt
- output.txt
- input.txt

Add the text you wish to encode to the input file. 

## To do

The following list details the next steps for this application. 
- Add required file structure to solution. 
- Restructure and implement service layer for cipher functions. 
- Add comprehensive unit test coverage.
- Add better documentation to code.
- Implement composite cipher.
- Implement fiestel cipher.
