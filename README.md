# Cryptography

C# Console app to exercise cryptographic algorithms. 

This project was created as a learning exercise to better understand cryptographic algorithms. It started with historic algorithms and the plan is to continue it to implement more modern algorithms. 

## Running the application

Add the text you wish to encode to the files/input.txt file. 
Following the encoding of your message the result will be written to the files/output.txt
When decoding a message, the output will be written to the files/decoded.txt

## To do

The following list details the next steps for this application. 

- Add comprehensive unit test coverage.
- Add better documentation to code.
- Implement composite cipher (Started on branch).
- Implement fiestel cipher.
